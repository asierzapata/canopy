# Rust

- Before executing tests with `cargo test` run `cargo build` to check if you did any errors.

# Documentation

- Whenever you need context of the project, search files inside the `./documentation` folder
- For a quick reference of GPUI framework read `./documentation/gpui.md`
- When you need to search docs for dependencies, use `context7` tools.
- If you are unsure how to do something, use `gh_grep` to search code examples from GitHub.
